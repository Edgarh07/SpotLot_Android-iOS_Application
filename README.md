# SpotLot_Android-iOS_Application
SpotLot is an Android/iOS application that was created as project to be submitted for my undergraduate Software Development class at California State University, San Bernardino. My team was composed of 6 undergraduate students with the objective of creating a new app service that would be of an improvement and benefit to our specified demographic, in our case the students and staff at CSUSB. My teammates and I created an application where students and staff were able to determine if a parking space was occupied or vacant, pay for parking permits, and integrated a chat feature where users can inform each other about vehicles in the parking lot (example: driver left headlights on). Using the Agile Methodology for software developers our team created flow charts, used a Kanban board, had standup meetings, and created a Software Requirement Speciation (SRS) document for the application. Our Android and iOS application were both created from using the platform Xamarin.
